MHFM Iphone App - Capstone Project for NSS 2013.

Phase 1
Plan out App -  The challenge here is coming up with things that aren't already existing on the existing website.  The App will contain 3 main sections (inductees, exhibits and a radio station).  The inductee and exhibit pages will link to video clips.  After researching the options, I decided to use XCode and Phonegap.  

Phase 2
Build the HTML and CSS.  Using bootstrap, XCode and the IOS simulator, the app is taking shape.  There are over 110 pages of content.  Create images for loading images and app icons for the different models of iphones/ipods.

Phase 3
Enroll in the Apple ios Developer program ($99).  This will allow me to test my app on multiple iphones before it goes "live".  It also enables me to push the app up the the Apple App store when it is completed.

Phase 4
Enable scrolling in XCode.  Research and integrate the streaming radio content (this will consist of songs that are performed by the inductees or the instruments in the exhibits).  

Phase 5
Purchase the new media blanket licenses from Ascap, BMI and SESAC for the streaming music part of the app.
